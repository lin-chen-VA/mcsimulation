## Small Molecule Monte Carlo Simulation Program (SMMCSP)

### Introduction

> SMMCSP is a Monte Carlo simulation program written during my Master study at
> New Mexico State University (NMSU). 

> In 2005, I joined Dr. David E. Smith research
> group in Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at NMSU. At that time, Dr.
> Smith focused on the simulaiton of water in single wall carbon tube. He had a
> code writtein in Fortran 77. I started a simulation of purifying small
> chemicals from aquatic solutions with Dr. Smith's Fortran code.

> From 2005 to 2008, I wrote a couple of versions of code for different simulation
> systems. Writing code was easy. I spent a week to have a runnable code. However, 
> debuging code is painful. It is very often that I spent over 20 hours computer time
> to check if a result from simulation matches the paper reported value. The whole
> debug process usually took over a month.

> In 2008, I received a project from Dr. Smith simulating water in clay. At that time,
> I took C++ programming in Department of Computer Science. I decided to write a
> general small molecule Monte Carlo simulation program, by which I can simulate
> different system. Dr. Smith supported my ideas and helped me validate the results
> generated from this generic program.

### Inputs

#### input.in
* Fixed molecules

> To represent the fixed polymers, like carbon nanotube, the modules can be setup as fixed.
> No movement will be implemented on these molecules

* Non-fixed molecules

> To represent the movable molecules, like water molecules, the modules can be randomly
> selected and moved

#### model.in

> The templates of molecules of non-fixed molecules

#### parameter.in

> The paramters for a specific simulation system

#### system.in

> System parameters

### Outputs

#### gr.out

> pair-correlation funciton

#### number.out

> molecule numbers in each iteration

#### output.out

> molecule coordinates

### output.pdb

> It was a output of molecules in pdb format. However, since the pdb format has been adjusted, VMD cannot open the output pdb file anymore. If there is a chance, it will be adjusted.
